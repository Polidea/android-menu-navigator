  * list to choose from
  * data entry (text, number, phone number including selection from contact list)

Menu is fully configurable: the menus are described in .json files accompanied by icons used to display the menus. Menu navigator supports splashscreen, breadcrumb for navigation, including breadcrumb icons, it allows to register any transaction handlers (for example making a call or simply starting  another - custom - activity). Menu is fully configurable in .json files (Structure of the menu is described in [MenuFormat]). The menu structure can even be changed without the neef of reinstalling the application.
